## Philosophy

SciPy Latin America has a financial aids program
that provides funds to help those participants (lecturers, students and assistants)
to SciPy Latin America 2015.
We will only cover part of the expenses.
We encourage all those that need financial help to apply.
We will try our best to assign the best of our budget
for those people who really need financial help.
